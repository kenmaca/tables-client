# Tablesâ€”A silly but useful tool

I made this because I eat out frequently after work and hate waiting in line for a table. UI-wise, I wanted a dead simple app that I can extract information from at a glance while driving (I um, never did this, of course). Made in a day or so with React Native, Firebase, the Yelp V3 API, and Twilio.

Uses Twilio to make the calls and caches intelligently with other users in the same area (Twilio is expensive). This side of the app can be found on a separate backend git repository made with NodeJS. If you're interested, reach out directly to me and I'll grant you access: ken@kenma.ca.
